","Navajo Rug Weaver-Navajo rugs are worked on 
in the Navajo Hogans in winter and outside under a 
tree in the summer. Wool is sheared from the sheep, 
sorted and washed, carded to make fibers line in one 
direction and worked into a cord which is then dyed
to color and then used for weaving. These rugs are 
made completely of wool and are famed for their 
beauty and durability. –L524",1962-09-26,Postcard,"Elizabeth Jane and Steve Shanahan of Davey, NE",es,,"Coachella, California","Fort Lupton, Colorado",
