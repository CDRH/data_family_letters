en inglés tomando en consideración que, en el contexto de los Estados

incluye administradores, colegas y padres de familia que no pueden no
leer en español. Las instrucciones para los alumnos fueron escritas en
español, por ser ésta la lengua de instrucción y el objeto de estudio
de estas unidades pedagógicas.

<p>The following materials were designed to address the needs of High
School and college Spanish learners at the intermediate/advanced
levels. Our general goal is to allow students to use the resources of
the Shanahan collection to develop their linguistic skills and their
cultural competence as they learn about the experience of Mexican
American families at the start of the Twentieth Century.</p>
<p>The activities presented here were developed for two types of
students: Those who are speakers of Spanish as a heritage
language, and those who are learning it as a second language.</p>
<p>Following Beaudrie y Potowski (2014), we believe that speakers of
Spanish as a heritage language bring with them linguistic, social and
cultural knowledge that must be valued in the classroom. We understand
a heritage language learner as a student who grew up in a family  or
community environment where a minority language was spoken, and who
possesses an affective and cultural connection with that language.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the fact that, in the context of the United States,
most Spanish classrooms serve both types of students. Each teacher will
be free to adapt this material (and the other resources in the
collection), to fit the specific needs of their students.</p>
