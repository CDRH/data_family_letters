<p>Just received the letter you mailed on the 13th; I should have gotten it Saturday; don’t know why I didn’t. Anyway I could have got your Postal Savings while I was in Lincoln yesterday; if I would have known about it. I guess that it would be alright to go ahead and buy the lots if they are still there by the time I get to Lincoln to get your Savings Notes. The notes are in the deposit box at the bank so I’ll have to be there during the daytime so I can get them. Probably could drive up some morning and come back on the train.</p>

<p>I may get my notice from the Army. Jack got a registered letter again Saturday and I figure that it was suppose to be for me and somebody just got a hold of the wrong envelope; as it don’t seem that they would be sending him something after he has been on Active Duty a month now. So if that is the case they will send it back in a couple of days, I guess. If I do hear, I’ll call you or wire. It wouldn’t hurt I guess for you to cash some of your savings even if we didn’t buy the lots so I’ll send them anyway.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I got up at 4:00 A.M. and got an early start to Lincoln. I did the washing as soon as I got there then straightened up the trailer some. I washed the floor but didn’t get it waxed so you’ll have that to do later. We have a lot of room so can get some of the things out of the lockers in the basement and take them too. Mom gave Ruth Ann some of Helen’s old clothes and she was real glad to get them; so maybe she would want some of the things that are too small for you. Didn’t have anyone to look at the trailer; but I’ld just as soon rent it out as to sell it anyway. We could just park it in a trailer camp and rent it if I do go to the Army.</p>

<p>Our Reserve outfit is having a dance in the Lincoln Hotel on the 27th of October so I hope that we can go.  I have some typing to do to earn points so don’t have to attend the meetings too often, now.</p>
