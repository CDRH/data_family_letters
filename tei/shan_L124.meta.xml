<salute>Dear Folks,</salute>
</opener>

<p>I received your card and today I got your letter. Glad to hear from you.</p>
                
<p>I just wrote those men and told them that I already accepted a clerical job.</p>

<p>Jim was down tonight and we went up town for a while. I just got back and got those other letters written so am writing you so as to mail them all yet tonight. I mail them at the Depot.</p>

<p>Mr. Lollis left for Chicago tonight and will be back Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Last Saturday Mr. Lollis and I went up to Omaha. He saw some people in the afternoon, then we have a “chicken in the rough” for supper (half a chicken), after that we went to the Theatre and saw three shows and the KMA school was there. Maybe you heard the KMA program as it was broadcasted. Mr. Lollis paid for the diner and shows. When we got ready to come home it was quite disagreeable so he rent us a room

<pb facs="shan_l.463.jpg"/>

at the Tourist Tower cabins, so we stay there until Sunday morning then we came home. He let me drive going up and in Omaha.</p>

<p>I am getting along alright. I believe this job has a good future. Right now before the camp leaves we are cleaning up and getting ready to leave. Next week our groceries and supplies come in. Boy! you ought to see the order we made last night—4000lbs of sugar—300lbs powder sugar—300 lbs rasins and large amounts of everything. I will tell you all about the camp when I come home. I don’t know when that will be though.</p>

<p>I have to help with the groceries and supplies-keep and type reports-help in the commissary (place where we sell anything a man who works would buy-clothes-candy, etc.).</p>

<p>Last night we worked until 11:30—not very hard though.</p>

<p>You see I am working with the C.B.&amp;Q [Chicago, Burlington&amp;Quincy Railroad]. but with John J. Grier Co. with has these camps. We board and room the C.B.&amp;Q. employees for $8.75 a week.</p>

<pb facs="shan_l.464.jpg"/>

 <p>There are only five of us here now, but there will be more than 200 when camp opens the 6th of April. We will be in Crete for about a week then go to St. Joe, then to Colo. Then Wisconsin and I don’t know where all from there as we work all lines of C.B.&amp;Q.</p>

<p>I think I told you I would get to drive his car some. It is a 1941 Studebaker Commander. He has $50,000 insurance on it, and he is going to have my name put on the insurance with his.</p>

<p>I have got a Royal portable typewriter to used.</p>

<p>Jim and I might come down some night or Sunday. I am planning on coming down to the Jr. Play with Jim that night.</p>

<p>We sure get plenty to eat here. Mr. Lollis goes uptown and buys the best of everything. We have meat for every meal, potatoes, bread, butter, and usual one or two vegetables besides. He buys rolls, cakes, etc.</p>

<pb facs="shan_l.465.jpg"/>

<p>I think I will close for tonight, and go over and mail this. It is only about a block across to the Depot.</p>

<closer>
<salute>Tell everybody Hello!</salute>                    
<signed>Your son&amp;brother.,</signed>
</closer>

<postscript>
<p>P.S. We have our own light plant which is 110 volts, a car for kitchen, dinner cars, sleeping cars and everything including shower baths.</p>
<p>I got a letter back from the Civil Service. I got an average of 93.67 I think I will keep this job though even if I do get a change at C.S. before long.</p>
