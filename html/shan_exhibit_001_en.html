<p>The objects in this collection allow us to learn about everyday life for Latinos at the start of last century, and help us to better understand the impact of their experience of migration on their day to day. The writing features and the events narrated in these letters provide us with important clues about the Spanish that was used by Mexican American families during this period, and about their linguistic experience.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Mexican immigrants started to arrive in the Midwest since the end of the Nineteenth Century, their experience and their writing have remained mostly forgotten. This site describes the life trajectory of a family whose members exchanged letters written in Spanish and in English between Mexico and the United States, over the course of several decades. These documents allow us to observe the way in which larger historical events are intertwined with the lives of ordinary people.</p>
