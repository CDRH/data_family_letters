# Cartas a la Familia: De la migraci√≥n de Jesusita a Jane

Family Letters: On the Migration from Jesusita to Jane

This repository is intended for use with the [CDRH API](https://github.com/CDRH/api) and the [Family Letters Ruby on Rails application](https://github.com/CDRH/family_letters).

## Updating

See the [Datura documentation](https://github.com/CDRH/datura) for general updating and posting instructions. **NOTE: do not edit the CSV files -- they are generated from a spreadsheet (documents.csv) and a [mediacommons](https://mediacommons.unl.edu/luna/servlet/UNL~111~111) export (photographs.csv)**

## Work to be Done

This repository was designed before the Datura gem begin
to include individual fields in CsvToEs. At some point, this may
be rewritten to use the Datura methods for ease of maintenance and clarity of code.
